This project is about using NLP for finding semantic patterns in mental health conditions.

To run the project - 
Go through FINAL.ipynb - it contains the entire structure of the project.
Go through bert_create_embeddings - it contains how the MentalBERT model is used to create embeddings. 

Due to the large size of the inputs and outputs throughout this project a lot of code is commented out / used to save data locally or to colab. 
Any such data which need not be generated again, AND COULD FEASIBLY be uploaded to github can be found in the github repo. 

Certain files which were very large and could not be zipped (windows failure) or uploaded to github, will to be run through the code.
